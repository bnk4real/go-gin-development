# GO-gin-development: Building APIs with Gin and Hexagonal Architecture
his repository showcases the development of a robust API built using the powerful Gin framework for Go. It adheres to the well-established principles of Hexagonal Architecture for clean, maintainable, and testable code. PostgreSQL acts as the database backend, seamlessly integrated through the convenient GORM library.

Key Features:

Expressive and performant API: Leveraging Gin's intuitive design and optimization techniques, you can implement RESTful APIs with ease.
Clean code structure: Hexagonal Architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, promoting modularity and long-term sustainability.
Data persistence: PostgreSQL offers a reliable and scalable solution for your data storage needs.
Efficient ORM: GORM streamlines interactions with PostgreSQL, reducing boilerplate code and simplifying database operations.

Getting Started:

Prerequisites:

Go: Ensure you have a compatible version of Go installed (https://go.dev/doc/install).
PostgreSQL: Set up a PostgreSQL server ([[invalid URL removed]]([invalid URL removed])) and create a database.

Clone the repository:

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/bnk4real/go-gin-development.git
```

Install dependencies:

```Bash
cd go-gin-development
go mod download
```

Configure database:

Update the configuration file .env.locals with your PostgreSQL connection details.

Run the application:

Additional Notes:

- Feel free to add more details about the architecture, dependencies, specific use cases, or future plans for the project.
- Consider providing installation instructions for different platforms (e.g., Docker) if relevant.
- Showcase examples of complex API operations or feature usage.
- If you have a CI/CD pipeline, incorporate information about automated builds and deployments.
